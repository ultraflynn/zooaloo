- Both players start on S
- Board is automatically show once game is started
- Prompt should change to show players name
- Default action should change depending on game status
- Options should be given once a dice is rolled

Options after rolling:
- move up or down the board that many spaces
- getting to either end reverses direction
- landing on X means you get the next card
  getting a card should show the card, then action it in 2 steps
- landing on T takes you to your destination straight away
- passing an entrance should prompt to enter
- landing on S when all tasks completes ends the game

Need to implement a state machine.

O -> START -> etc
